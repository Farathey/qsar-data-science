Explores the usage of Simple Linear Regression and Multi Linear Regression

### Exercise 2 - Decision Trees
Shows the possibilities and usage of Decision Trees

### Exercise 3 - Random Forest
Expands the knowledge from previous exercise to Random Forest

### Exercise 4
Summary of the first three exercises and consolidates knowledge about Linear Regression, Decision Trees and Random Forest

### Exercise 5 k-NN
Explores the topic of k-Nearest-Neighbours Algorithm 

### Exercise 6 k-means
Focuses on the method of k-Means Clustering

### Exercise 7 Clustering
Compares usge of Hierarchcal Clustering Algorithm and k-Means Clustering

-----
* In Data directory were placed all of the needed csv sheets, used during the course
* Most of the code is undescribed, might change it later. There are some notes in Polish language.
